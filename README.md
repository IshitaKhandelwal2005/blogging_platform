This project is a modern, multi-user blogging platform that allows users to create, manage, and categorize blog posts. It was built as an assessment to demonstrate proficiency in modern full-stack development using the T3 stack principles.💻 Tech StackThis application is built with an end-to-end type-safe approach.CategoryTechnologyPurposeFrameworkNext.js 15 (App Router)Primary React framework for full-stack capabilities and routing.LanguageTypeScriptUsed end-to-end for type safety and maintainability.API LayertRPCEnables type-safe API calls directly from the frontend.DatabasePostgreSQL (via Neon/Supabase)Primary relational database for persistence.ORMDrizzle ORMA modern, type-safe ORM for database schema definition and querying.ValidationZodUsed for runtime schema validation of all API inputs and outputs.Data FetchingReact Query (TanStack Query)Integrated via tRPC for server-state management, caching, and background updates.State ManagementZustandUsed for light, global client-side state management (e.g., UI toggles, draft state).StylingTailwind CSSUtility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.UI Componentsshadcn/uiUsed for pre-built, accessible, and themeable UI components.Content EditorMarkdownA simple textarea combined with a markdown parser was chosen for faster implementation.✨ Features Implemented ChecklistPriorityFeatureStatusNotes🔴 P1Blog post CRUD operations✅Full functionality implemented.🔴 P1Category CRUD operations✅Full functionality implemented.🔴 P1Assign categories to posts (Many-to-Many)✅Users can assign one or more categories upon post creation/editing.🔴 P1Blog listing page showing all posts✅Home page displays all published posts.🔴 P1Individual post view page✅Dynamic routing based on slug.🔴 P1Category filtering on listing page✅Users can filter posts by selecting a category.🔴 P1Basic responsive navigation✅Navigation is functional across all viewports.🔴 P1Clean, professional UI✅Achieved using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.🟡 P2Landing page (Header/Hero, Features, Footer)✅3-section landing page is implemented.🟡 P2Dashboard page for managing posts✅Dedicated admin area for post and category management.🟡 P2Draft vs Published post status✅Posts can be saved as drafts and only published ones appear on the main site.🟡 P2Loading and error states✅Implemented using React Query states.🟡 P2Mobile-responsive design✅Layout adapts to mobile viewports.🟡 P2Content editor (Markdown)✅Basic markdown support for content creation.🟢 P3Post statistics (reading time)⏱️Implemented estimated reading time calculation.🟢 P3Post preview functionality⏱️A basic preview of markdown content is available during editing.🟢 P3Pagination🚧Decision made not to implement (See Trade-offs)🚀 Getting StartedFollow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.PrerequisitesNode.js (v18+)PostgreSQL Database (Local or cloud-hosted, e.g., Neon, Supabase)npm or yarn1. Clone and InstallBashgit clone https://github.com/IshitaKhandelwal2005/blogging_platform.git
cd blogging_platform
npm install
# or
yarn install
2. Environment VariablesCreate a file named .env in the root directory and add your PostgreSQL connection string:Code snippet# Database connection string for Drizzle ORM
DATABASE_URL="postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
3. Database SetupUse Drizzle's commands to push the schema and seed the database.Run Migrations (Schema Push):Bashnpm run db:push
Seed the Database:The seed script populates the database with initial categories (e.g., Design, Development) and a few sample published and draft posts for testing.Bashnpm run seed
4. Run the Development ServerBashnpm run dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.📐 Architecture Decisions and Trade-offstRPC Router StructureThe tRPC API is structured to maintain a clear separation of concerns and mirror the application's domain.Main Router (src/server/api/root.ts): Acts as the entry point, combining all sub-routers.Sub-Routers (src/server/api/routers/): Each major domain entity gets its own dedicated router:post.ts: Handles all CRUD operations related to blog posts.category.ts: Handles all CRUD operations related to categories.Type Inference: This structure allows for seamless, automatic type inference into the frontend, ensuring that changes in the backend procedures or Zod schemas immediately flag type errors on the frontend.Implementation DecisionsDecision MadeReasoning/Trade-offChosen UI Library: shadcn/uiTrade-off: Saved estimated 3-4 hours of UI development time, aligning with the "Recommended Shortcuts" to focus on core logic and architecture.Content Editor: MarkdownTrade-off: Saved estimated 2-3 hours by avoiding a complex rich-text editor setup (e.g., Tiptap), ensuring Priority 1 features were polished.No AuthenticationAlignment with Requirement: The assignment explicitly stated that authentication was NOT required, allowing maximum focus on core post/category management logic and type-safe data flow.Omitted P3 Feature: PaginationTrade-off: Pagination was a Nice to Have. Since the seed data is small, basic filtering was prioritized over pagination to ensure a complete, polished set of Priority 1 features within the time limit.Optimistic UpdatesImplemented optimistic updates on Post Deletion and Category Creation/Deletion to provide immediate UI feedback, a key factor for good UX.✅ Evaluation FocusThe project was primarily developed with the evaluation criteria in mind, specifically focusing on:Code Organization: Clear separation of database schema (src/db), API logic (src/server), and UI components.TypeScript Implementation: 100% type safety achieved end-to-end, relying heavily on tRPC's automatic inference and Drizzle's typed results.API Design: Every tRPC procedure uses a dedicated Zod schema for input validation and comprehensive error handling.Database Design: The many-to-many relationship between Posts and Categories is correctly modeled with a dedicated join table in Drizzle.🌐 Live DeploymentLive URL: [INSERT YOUR VERCEl DEPLOYMENT LINK HERE]
