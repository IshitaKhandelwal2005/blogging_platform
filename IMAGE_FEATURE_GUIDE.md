## How to Use

### 1. Setup Cloudinary (Required for Image Upload)

To enable image uploads, you need to configure Cloudinary:

1. Create a free account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free)
2. Get your credentials from the dashboard
3. Add them to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```
4. Restart your development server

ðŸ“– **See [CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md](./CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions**

### 2. Run the Migration
Before using the feature, apply the database migration:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### 3. Adding Images to Posts

When creating or editing a post, you have **two options**:

#### Option A: Upload an Image File
1. Click "Choose File" under the "Upload Image" section
2. Select an image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP)
3. Maximum file size: 5MB
4. The image will be uploaded to Cloudinary (cloud storage)
5. A preview will appear automatically with the Cloudinary URL

#### Option B: Use an Image URL
1. Enter a valid image URL in the "Image URL" field
2. The image will preview below the input field
3. If the URL is invalid, the preview won't display

**Note:** The image field is optional - posts without images will work as before

### 4. Viewing Posts with Images

Posts with images will display the featured image:
- Below the post title
- Above the categories
- Full width with responsive sizing
- Rounded corners and shadow for visual appeal
